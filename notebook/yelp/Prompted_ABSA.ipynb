Every time I go up to NJ, I make sure I take this bridge. The view from the bridge is amazing. I love the waterfront PA/NJ scenery. It's best to have EZ Pass during busy times. The EZ pass makes getting through the tolls a lot smoother. If you are riding across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, enjoy the waterfront view.   \n",

Every time I go up to NJ, I make sure I take this bridge. The view from the bridge is amazing. I love the waterfront PA/NJ scenery. It's best to have EZ Pass during busy times. The EZ pass makes getting through the tolls a lot smoother. If you are riding across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, enjoy the waterfront view.   \n",

The EZ pass makes getting through the tolls a lot smoother. If you are riding across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, enjoy the waterfront view.   \n",
