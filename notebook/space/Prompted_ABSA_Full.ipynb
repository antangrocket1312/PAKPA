       "4999  [We have just returned from our recent stay at the Roman Spa hotel in Calistoga, California., We are very happy to submit a glowing review for this unparalleled relaxation and rejuvenation spot., We have stayed at several other places in Calistoga in the past, as we love the area - but after our first visit to Roman Spa many years ago, we never go anywhere else due to its excellent value, its lush garden-like landscaping and the three superb mineral water pools., Each pool is delightfully warm, one slightly warmer than the next., The geothermal mineral water in the pools is truly a special pleasure to soak in, and it leaves skin very soft, among other benefits., We take advantage of the 2-night internet specials for midweek nights only., This provides the best rate for the best hotel in the area., There are more expensive and perhaps more luxurious rooms at other hotels, but for overall relaxation and rejuvenation at pricing that is conducive to said relaxation, Roman Spa is by far the best value., The rooms are clean and simple, and tastefuly decorated., The hotel offers free coffee, and other seasonal specials if you check the internet., For those who enjoy wine-tasting, Calistoga is at the 'high end' of the Napa valley, and has numerous specialty wineries within minutes from the hotel., Additionally, the nearby Palisades range offers spectacular vistas for the excercise-minded vacationer who enjoys hiking or biking., Right next door is the Oasis mud bath and massage spa, only a few feet from the hotel., Combine a package at Oasis with a stay at Roman Spa for one of the most comprehensive relaxation treatments available anywhere., We can't wait till we can return again, and enjoy poolside coffee while soaking in the therapeutic waters!]   \n",
