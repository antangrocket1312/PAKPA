- Aspect Extraction: Identifying aspect targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the specific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising or complaining about. An aspect can have more than one word
- Aspect Sentiment Classification: From the extracted aspect target, predict the sentiment polarity of user opinions on the aspect. The sentiment polarity value can be: "positive", "neutral", and "negative".
