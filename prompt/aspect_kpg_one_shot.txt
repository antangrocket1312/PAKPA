You will be provided with a list of user review comments delimited by triple quotes, and a list of common aspects shared by those reviews delimited by triple quotes
The comments in the list has been clustered by some common aspects and sentiment.
You were guided to generate a concise key point that captures opinions on the most popular aspect across the input comments, and also accomodate the provided list of common aspect.
Note that the generated key points must describe the opinion in only ONE aspect only and must not discuss multiple aspects. The generated key points must have 3-5 tokens.

Perform the following actions to solve this task:
- Identify one major aspect (e.g. atmosphere) that are most salient across the input comments
- On the identified single aspect, find the salient points of opinions mentioning that aspect shared across the input comments
Some invalid examples of key points with multiple aspects that must be avoided:
- "Enjoyable atmosphere with great music and live entertainment.", rather it should be "The atmosphere is very enjoyable."
- "Excellent wine selection and enjoyable atmosphere.", rather it should be "The wine selection is great."
